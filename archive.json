Suppose the CA has OID1, and the EE has OID2 but includes mappings (OID1 -> OID2). One might think, from reading that, that this checks out and we have an OID1 -> OID2 chain. But that would be off by one. The EE's OIDs match _first_. The mappings only apply to _subsequent_ certificates.\r\n\r\nBecause really the problem is that, although the fields are named subject and issuer, issuer actually refers to yourself and subject refers to the next one!\r\n\r\nPerhaps:\r\n\r\n> ... allows a CA certificate to map its policy OIDs to different policy OIDs in certificates that it issues\r\n\r\nAnd then we also drop the confusing \"policy domain\" terminology which, IIRC, shows up in the ITU spec but not the IETF spec.",
